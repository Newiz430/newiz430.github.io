## Open-source Projects

#### [CSGCL: Community-Strength-Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning](https://github.com/HanChen-HUST/CSGCL) (IJCAI-23 main track)

A graph contrastive learning framework aiming to preserve community strength throughout the learning process. 

Firstly, we present two novel graph augmentation methods, Communal Attribute Voting (CAV) and Communal Edge Dropping (CED), where the perturbations of node attributes and edges are guided by community strength. Secondly, we propose a dynamic ''Team-up'' contrastive learning scheme, where community strength is used to progressively fine-tune the contrastive objective. 

#### [Counting is All You Need: Weakly-Supervised Immunohistochemical Cell Segmentation and Localization by Numbers](https://github.com/Newiz430/CellSegmentation) (2021-2022)

A multi-stage auto-immunoquantitative analytical model based on Multiple Instance Learning for immune cell counting, localization and segmentation. 

Taking immunohistochemistry-stained digital cell images as input, the model is merely supervised by positive cell counting labels and transforms whole-image (bag) level counting results into superpixel (instance) level classification results via the specifically designed adaptive top-k instance selection strategy.

This work has achieved 4th place in **Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon** (LYSTO) Challenge. [Leaderboard](https://lysto.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge/leaderboard/)
