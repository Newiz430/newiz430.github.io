## Open-source Projects

#### [CellSegmentation](https://github.com/Newiz430/CellSegmentation) (2021-2022)

A multi-stage auto-immunoquantitative analytical model based on Multiple Instance Learning for immune cell counting, localization and segmentation. 

Taking immunohistochemistry-stained digital cell images as input, the model is merely supervised by positive cell counting labels and transforms whole-image (bag) level counting results into superpixel (instance) level classification results via the specifically designed adaptive top-k instance selection strategy.

This work has achieved 4th place in **Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon** (LYSTO) Challenge. [Leaderboard](https://lysto.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge/leaderboard/)

#### [SplicePredictor](https://github.com/Newiz430/SplicePredictor) (2021)

Finding functional sites in genetic DNA using the weight array model (WAM), Bayesian Network (BN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where it all began. 

#### [BlogBackground](https://github.com/Newiz430/BlogBackground) (2020)

A backend blog project based on MVC framework using PHP, MySQL and Smarty.
